# Quick Commerce Price Comparison - Learning Project

## 🎯 Purpose
Educational tool for understanding how quick-commerce platforms (Swiggy Instamart, Blinkit, etc.) work behind the scenes.

## 🔧 Why Puppeteer?
Platforms use advanced bot protection:
- **AWS WAF/CAPTCHA** challenges
- **Dynamic session tokens**
- **JavaScript-rendered content**
- **Cookie-based authentication**
- **Rate limiting** based on behavior

Puppeteer simulates real browsers, bypassing these protections.

## 🚀 Quick Start
To verify api ends points quickly through puppeteer, run :- 

npm init -y
npm install puppeteer
node <script>.js
